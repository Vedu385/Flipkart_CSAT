# Flipkart_CSAT
This project focuses on predicting Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores for Flipkart's customer support interactions using machine learning. With the increasing importance of customer experience in e-commerce, accurately forecasting satisfaction levels helps businesses like Flipkart proactively address service quality issues. The dataset includes various features such as issue type, support channel, agent experience, resolution time, and more. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, a Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict CSAT scores ranging from 1 to 5. The model was evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and visualized through confusion matrix and feature importance plots. To make the model interactive, a simple Flask-based web interface was built, allowing users to input new service data and receive instant satisfaction predictions. This end-to-end solution demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to drive actionable insights in customer service operations.
